Gravitron is a HTML5 game made with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

You can play it on [Itch.io](http://neko250.itch.io/gravitron) or on [Game Jolt](http://gamejolt.com/games/puzzle/gravitron/42799/)

When I was a child I had got a little board game. I loved it.  
Several years later, I decided to implement that old game from my childhood in code...
